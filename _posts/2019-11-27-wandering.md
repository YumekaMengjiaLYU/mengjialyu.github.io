Today I went out with Kari and we went to  several stores, including Sephora, & Other Stories, Forever 21, Actavis and MUJI. There were a lot of items on sale at Forever 21, but most of theme do not feel to be of a good quality. The only thing I bought eventually is a pair of short leggings, which I intend to use for my workout class. It's interesting that none of the items they had interests me even though they had so many clothes -- dresses, sweaters, leopards etc. Volume takes precedence before quality, and as many people have found out, the clothes wouldn't last through many washes and get worn out quickly. For people who only care about cheap price and fancy look, the store does have attractive selections. The whole idea of fast fashion, which consists of high quality runway alternatives, is alluring to many who do not feel financially secured. Of course I am also one of them, as I currently have no source of direct personal income. Probably I will ONLY shop at high-end stores when I start to have a well-paid job; I might also stop looking at weekly ads anymore from drug stores or supermarkets; discounts would not bother me and I would be fully content buying things at full price instead of go bargain hunting.

To quote consumer psychologist Dr. Dimitri Tsivrikos,

> These prices are obviously used to convince you that you are spending less than you actually are. A price reduction makes it even more tempting. The bargain price is appealing to you because it challenges the status quo. The retailer appears not to be in complete control of the final price of the product, and this makes you feel that you are now in control. And because of that you feel you can negotiate the final price that you have to pay - whether that is the sale price or even a buy one get one free deal...

To quote the article

> "[Benson] says that when it comes to bargain-hunting addictions, what people buy isn't as important as how big the price reduction is. In fact, the bigger the price cut, the more tempting a purchase is. After all, if something's 80% off the original price - you're saving 80 percent! What you may not consider is that by not buying, you'll save 100%. Bargain addicts also make illogical purchases, like grabbing up sale-price auto parts for cars they don't own, or bargain kid's clothes for children they don't have... So, why is a bargain-hunting addiction so common? Tim Kasser, a professor of psychology at Knox College in Illinois, says it's a way for people to ease insecurities, and feel more competent and in control. In fact, shopping addicts often don't realize they have a problem, even when the bags and bills start stacking up. It usually takes a big event to bring it to their attention, like divorce, a new baby, unemployment, or retirement. Or they simply max out their credit cards, and have no more spending power."

To quote Mark Ellwood,

> "As it turns out, a passion for finding bargains is genetically preprogrammed in all humans, although it's activated much more in some than others. Spotting special offers triggers a release of dopamine, the feel-good neurotransmitter ...

I have certainly made a lot of regretful purchases because of discount!! Clothing makes up a big part - I used to go to websites like Macy, Nordstrom Rack and other fast fashion brands like F21, HM, Zara, Charlotte Russe etc and would click on the Sale or Clearance and would spend hours choosing the right items to buy. I felt the compulsion to buy something - no matter the kind or quantity - just have to buy SOMETHING. Sadly, a lot of these clothing were not rightly treated by me and many were donated or rarely worn. I do not feel grateful for owning them or for them being there for me. Reflecting on my bargain-hunting behavior, I realize that this can never foster a mutually-beneficial person-belonging relationship. I want all of my relationships to be mutually beneficial, be it my relationship with the earth, my relationship with other humans, or my relationship with my belongings. That is why I exist: to be part of relationships that are mutually beneficial.

Perhaps my insecurities is the reason for my addiction for bargain hunting.
