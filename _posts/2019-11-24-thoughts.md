It's been almost three months since the start of the semester,
and I just notice from actually taking a close look at my graded homework that
I lost points many times
for not showing E[|X|] exists.

This motivates me to google and find the following theorem:

A random variable X has expectation if and only if |X| has expectation.

However, if we can show that the integral of expectation is equal to 1, isn't existence self-evident
since the integral converges?

After checking the solutions for the homework, I realize that I have to add
E[|X|] = E[X] before actually calculating the E[X].

Another mistake that I repeatedly made in the homework is that I did not explicitly
state the function is bigger than zero to prove that some function is a pdf.


So I googled again, and find out that pdf p(x) should satisfy three properties:

1. The probability that x can take a specific value is p(x)

2. p(x) is non-negative for all real x.

3. The sum of p(x) over all possible values of x is 1.
