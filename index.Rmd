I graduated from the [University of California] (http://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) with a BS in electrical engineering in 2017.\
In 2019 I began working toward a MS in biostatistics at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics). \
I am actively looking for internships in data science/data engineering.
