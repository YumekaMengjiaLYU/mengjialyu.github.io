title: About Me 
---
<p>
There was a time when\

I wanted to be so many things.\
I wanted to be a scientist.\
I wanted to be an IC designer.\
I wanted to be a professor.\
I wanted to be a singer.\
I wanted to be a writer.\
I wanted to be a dancer.\
I wanted to be a farmer.\


I have realized now that the noun that can summarize who I am simply does not exist.\

To borrow from Walt Whitman: "I am large, I contain multitudes".\

I have also realized that who I want to be is already within me.\

All I need, is patience, perseverance and practice.\

To be the data engineer that I will one day be.\
