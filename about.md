title: About Me 
---
<p>
There was a time when
<p>
I wanted to be so many things.
<p>
I wanted to be a scientist.
<p>
I wanted to be an IC designer.
<p>
I wanted to be a professor.
<p>
I wanted to be a singer.
<p>
I wanted to be a writer.
<p>
I wanted to be a dancer.
<p>
I wanted to be a farmer.

...

<p>
I have realized now that the noun that can summarize who I am simply does not exist.

<p>
To borrow from Walt Whitman: **"I am large, I contain multitudes"**.

<p>
I have also realized that who I want to be is already within me.

<p>
All I need, is **patience, perseverance and practice**.

<p>
To become the person that I am destined to be.
